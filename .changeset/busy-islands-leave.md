'safe-mdx': patch
---

Add Vite demo showcasing safe-mdx with React, Tailwind CSS v4, and ESM component imports. The demo uses Tailwind CSS v4's new CSS-first configuration approach with the @plugin directive for typography styles. It demonstrates MDX ESM imports with the allowClientEsmImports boolean option, allowing direct imports from URLs like `import IOKnob from 'https://framer.com/m/IOKnob-DT0M.js@eZsKjfnRtnN8np5uwoAx'`. The demo includes comprehensive MDX features including headings, code blocks, tables, lists, and dynamic component loading. Run with `pnpm demo` to see safe-mdx in action with modern tooling and styling.
